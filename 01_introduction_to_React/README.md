# Introduction to React

[React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) is a Javascript library for building user interfaces. It's a framework for modifying an HTML page's structure (the DOM - the Document Object Model) dynamically.

Some features of React, compared to other front-end frameworks:

- It's smart about updates (so you don't have to be): complex data, like lists of records, can be modified in code and the page updates to match. Other frameworks require you to explicitly add, remove or modify page elements to match the data.

- It allows a mix of Javascript code and XML, so that structure becomes declarative. Page content can still be expressed as HTML, even inside code. (React supports an extension of Javascript called JSX.)

The code snippets in the presentation start with a simple example - "printing" the date in an HTML page - and gradually introduce more complex structures and interaction.
